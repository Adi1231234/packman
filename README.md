# @boco/packman

Bulk download, publish, and copy packages and their dependencies by using the command line.

Currently supports npm but future support for pypi and other package managers is planned.

## Getting Started

Install packman:

```bash
npm install @boco/packman -g
```

## Using the CLI

`packman` uses `commander` and is modular by design.
There are three layers of commands.

1. The first layer are named after the package managers: `npm`, `pypi`, `nexus`, etc.
2. The second layer are the names of the operations: `download`, `publish`, `copy`, etc.
3. The third and last layer are modes of operation: `package`, `package-lock`, etc.

We don't nest deeper than three layers.
Anything beyond that is an argument.
The primary arguments are typically unprefixed, whereas the rest are prefixed with `--`.
Check the usage info for the details.

You can append `--help` at any layer to see the relavent arguments and sub-commands.
So you can run:
* `packman --help`
* `packman command --help`
* `packman command sub-command --help`

## `npm`

### Download packages

Download packages based on any of the following:

- the name [and version] of a package
- a local `package-lock.json` file
- the url to a `package-lock.json` file
- a local `package.json` file
- the url to a `package.json` file
- the results of an npm search by keyword

Packages can be downloaded from any npm repository.
* The default is https://registry.npmjs.org/.
* The registry can often be overriden by using the `--registry`, `--source`, or `--target` arguments, depending on the command. Check the command's arguments to be sure.

The downloaded packages will be stored by default in a `tarballs` subdirectory of the current directory.
* The subdirectory will be created if necessary.
* You can specify a different subdirectory by using the `--directory` argument.

#### package name [and version]

##### by name:

```base
packman npm download package lodash
```

Will download the latest version of the package.

##### by name and version:

```base
packman npm download package lodash 4.17
```

##### by name, including `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies`:

```base
packman npm download package lodash --devDependencies --peerDependencies
```

#### package-lock.json

##### from local file:

```bash
packman npm download package-lock ./path/to/package-lock.json
```

##### from url:

```bash
packman npm download package-lock https://path/to/package-lock.json
```

#### package.json

##### from local file:

```bash
packman npm download package-json ./path/to/package.json
```

##### from url:

```bash
packman npm download package-json https://path/to/package.json
```

#### search keyword:

downloads the packages returned from an npm search query (https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?)

```base
packman npm download search lodash
```

Keep in mind that all of the packages returned in the search results *and their dependencies* will be downloaded.
If you're not careful, this could download a huge number of packages, which is probably not what you want.
Wield with care.

### Publish packages

Publish packages stored in a directory generated by the `npm download` command (e.g., `./tarballs`) to the current registry.

The `packman npm publish` command does not perform authentication.
You have to authenticate with the target registry before you run it.

#### Publish with `npm`

```bash
packman npm publish tarballs ./path/to/tarballs
```

By default, the packages will be published to the current registry.
You can publish to a different registry by using the `--registry` argument.

```bash
packman npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873/
```

### Copy packages

The `packman npm copy` command essentially downloads all the specified packages from a *source* registry and publishes them to a *target* registry.

* The *source* registry must be specified, except for the package-lock mode.
* The default *target* registry is always the current registry, determined by running `npm get registry`. It can be overridden by passing the `--target` argument.

Many of the `copy` subcommands and arguments mirror the `download` subcommands and arguments, but there are a few important differences:

* `download` uses the current registry as its source, whereas `copy` uses it as its target.
* `copy` uses `--source` and `--target` arguments (as necessary) to specify the registries instead of the `download` command's `--registry` argument.
* `copy` generates a new timestamped tarballs directory every time the command is run, whereas `download` reuses the single `tarballs` subdirectory.

Note that the list of differences is based on the default behavior when the relevant arguments are not overridden.

#### package name [and version]

##### by name:

```base
packman npm copy package lodash --source https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

Will download and then publish the latest version of the package.

##### by name and version:

```base
packman npm copy package lodash 4.17 --source https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

##### by name, including `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies`:

```base
packman npm copy package lodash --devDependencies --peerDependencies --source https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

#### package-lock.json

The `--source` argument is not supported for the `package-lock` command because the absolute URIs of the packages are specified in the `package-lock.json` file.

##### from local file:

```bash
packman npm copy package-lock ./path/to/package-lock.json
```

##### from url:

```bash
packman npm copy package-lock https://path/to/package-lock.json
```

#### package.json

##### from local file:

```bash
packman npm copy package-json ./path/to/package.json --source https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

##### from url:

```bash
packman npm copy package-json https://path/to/package.json --source https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

#### search keyword:

downloads the packages returned from an npm search query (https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?)

```base
packman npm copy search lodash --source https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

Keep in mind that all of the packages returned in the search results *and their dependencies* will be downloaded and then published.
If you're not careful, this could download a huge number of packages, which is probably not what you want.
It might also take a significant amount of time to publish them.
Wield with care.

## `Nexus`

For the most part, we will work with packages hosted in Nexus using their respective clients and will almost never use the Nexus API directly.
However, accessing the Nexus API directly is sometimes necessary.

### Publish packages

Publishing packages stored in a directory generated by the `npm download` command (e.g., `./tarballs`) to the current registry.

The `packman nexus publish` command does not perform authentication.
You have to authenticate with the target registry before you run it.

```bash
packman nexus publish tarballs ./path/to/tarballs
```

By default, the packages will be published to the current registry.
You can publish to a different registry by using the `--registry` argument.

```bash
packman nexus publish tarballs --registry http://localhost:4873/
```
